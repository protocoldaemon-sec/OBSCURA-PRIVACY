Railway Redeploy Trigger - Fix Double Transfer Bug

Timestamp: 2025-01-19 23:45:00
Commit: 9abfc7d
Issue: Double transfer bug still happening in production
Reason: Railway hasn't redeployed with latest code

Changes in commit 9abfc7d:
- Removed duplicate directTransfer() call in settlement block
- Settlement block now reuses cSPL transfer result
- No second transfer execution

Expected behavior after redeploy:
- Only 1 transfer per withdrawal
- User receives correct amount (not 2x)
- Single TX hash in response

This file triggers Railway auto-redeploy.
